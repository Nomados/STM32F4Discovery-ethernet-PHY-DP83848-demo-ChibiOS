@par Description

This directory contains a set of sources files that implement a web server
application, based on the netconn API, for STM32F4x7 devices.

Please note that for http server netconn demonstration, LwIP v1.3.2 is used as
the TCP/IP stack and FreeRTOS v6.1.0 is used as the Real Time Kernel.

@par Hardware and Software environment
  
  - This example has been tested with the following environments:
     - STM324xG-EVAL board
     - Http clients: Firefox Mozilla (v3.6 and later) or Microsoft Internet Explorer (v8 and later)
     - DHCP server: PC utility TFTPD32 (http://tftpd32.jounin.net/) is used as a DHCP server
  
  - STM324xG-EVAL Set-up
    - Connect STM324xG-EVAL board to remote PC (through a crossover ethernet cable)
      or to your local network (through a straight ethernet cable)
    - STM324xG-EVAL jumpers setting

    (*) User have to provide the 50 MHz clock by soldering a 50 MHz oscillator (ref SM7745HEV-50.0M or
        equivalent) on the U3 footprint located under CN3 and also removing jumper on JP5. This oscillator
        is not provided with the board. 
        For more details, please refer to STM3240G-EVAL evaluation board User manual (UM1461).
    @Note: the default setting is MII mode, to change it to RMII mode refer to main.h file.
